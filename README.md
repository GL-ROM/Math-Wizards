# Math Wizards
## Concept: 
The game is an edutainment math practice game. You must solve math problems to build up "mana" and defeat the math wizards. There are 4 rounds with a different math operator in each.
## Technologies Used:
    - JQuery - JavaScript - HTML - CSS - Google Fonts 
    - GIMP  
## Approach: 
I was first inspired by the old classic edutainment game called Math Blasters for PC back in the 90s. I wanted to do something similar but with an almost RPG like feel. Unfortunately my fresh out the box skillset did not fit my expansive mind and desire to create. Once I dove into the pseudocode I quickly realized I had to boil down the game and keep it simple with the first itiration. 

Once I realized that, it started to flow much better. I still, have some code commented out that I hope to get back to when time permits. I had to scrap a lot of ideas and keep simplifying. I also quickly realized I needed a better approach as my code started to become very wet and spaghetti like. I am still not completely happy with the end result but hope to refactor as well.

I think for my next projects I will try to follow a more logical order and less of an "oh I defintiely need this function" mindset. 
## Challenges: 
I faced a ton of challenges on this project. One of which was figuring out positioning in CSS and trying to get divs exactly where I wanted them. Researched tons of methods and tried even more. I was finally able to figure out how to postion them the way I needed and learned a lot from it. Defintiely will need to practice that more but feel good about it. 

Another challenge was realizing that calling event listeners a bunch of times is a no no because they apprently stack? Spent plenty of hours trying to figure that bug out and could not for the life of me until I looked at the DOM as it was happening and deciphered where it orginated. What a hunt but got it fixed and it actualyl allowed me to clean up my code a bit.
## Additional information: 
This project was a great learning piece, as most of my discoveries came from thought out approaches and troubleshooting. Tons of mispelling mistakes and repition but I feel like I took away a lot from the project itself.
